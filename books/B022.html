<h2>Ray Dalio Principles: Life and Work</h2>

Jan 2019

<h3>Part II: Life Principles</h3>

<blockquote>1. Have clear goals. 2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. 4. Design plans that will get you around them. 5. Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results. p.181</blockquote>

<blockquote>Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things that you want or need even more. p.183</blockquote>

<blockquote>f. Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low. p.184</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ideally, someone other than you should be objectively measuring and reporting on your progress. p.188</blockquote>

<blockquote>Holding wrong opinions in one’s head and making bad decisions based on them instead of having thoughtful disagreements is one of the greatest tragedies of mankind. Being able to thoughtfully disagree would so easily lead to radically improved decision making in all areas. p.202</blockquote>

<blockquote>In some cases in which the subjects are just too complex for me to understand in the time required, I will turn over the decision making to knowledgeable others who are more believable than me, but I still want to listen in on their thoughtful disagreement. p.202</blockquote>
