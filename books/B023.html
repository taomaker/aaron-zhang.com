<h3>Strategies for Problem Solving</h3>

<blockquote>General Dwight D. Eisenhower was famous for saying, “I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.” He meant that battles are so chaotic that it is impossible to predict everything that could happen and have a predetermined response for every outcome. In that sense, then, plans are useless on the battlefield (another military leader, the Prussian Helmuth von Moltke, famously said that “no plan survives first contact with the enemy”). But no army can succeed without planning and organization. Through planning, a general learns what his army’s capabilities are, how the different parts of the army work together, and so on. p.32</blockquote>

<blockquote>Therefore, working is no positive reinforcement from your efforts until the end. If instead, you create a plan with a series of minor goals, even if some seem tangential to the main problem, you will make measurable progress toward a solution and feel that your time has been spent usefully. At the end of each work session, you’ll be able to check off items from your plan, gaining confidence that you will find a solution instead of growing increasingly frustrated. p.33</blockquote>
