<h2>Tools of Titans</h2>

Jan 2018

<h3>Read This First—How to Use This Book</h3>

<blockquote>The superheroes you have in your mind (idols, icons, titans, billionaires, etc.) are nearly all walking flaws who’ve maximized 1 or 2 strengths. Humans are imperfect creatures. You don’t “succeed” because you have no weaknesses; you succeed because you find your unique strengths and focus on developing habits around them. - p.18</blockquote>

<h3>Chris Sacca</h3>

<blockquote>Chris was well known at Google for showing up to meetings with anyone, including the co-founders. Even if attendees looked at each other puzzled, Chris would sit down and let them know he’d be taking notes for them. It worked. p.169</blockquote>

<h3>Derek Sivers</h3>

<blockquote>Well, I meet a lot of 30-year-olds who are trying to pursue many different directions at once, but not making progress in any, right? .. can do one of these things for a few years, and then do another one for a few years, and then another. Focus on one thing in a relatively long period of time. p.189</blockquote>

<blockquote>Every time people contact me, they say, ‘Look, I know you must be incredibly busy . . .’ and I always think, ‘No, I’m not.’ Because I’m in control of my time. I’m on top of it. ‘Busy,’ to me, seems to imply ‘out of control.’ Control your time Be the master of your time and energy. p.191</blockquote>

<h3>Matt Mullenweg</h3>

<blockquote>I think a lot of the mistakes of my youth were mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth. So just slowing down, whether that’s meditating, whether that’s taking time for yourself away from screens, whether that’s really focusing in on who you’re talking to or who you’re with.” p.206</blockquote>

<h3>Tony Robbins</h3>

<blockquote>Quality Questions Create a Quality Life Tony sometimes phrases this as, “The quality of your life is the quality of your questions.” Questions determine your focus. Most people—and I’m certainly guilty of this at times—spend their lives focusing on negativity (e.g., “How could he say that to me?!”) and therefore the wrong priorities. p.210</blockquote>

<blockquote>The reason you’re suffering is you’re focused on yourself. p.210</blockquote>

<h3>Peter Thiel</h3>

<blockquote>So I think, every day, it’s something to reflect on and think about ‘How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful?’ p.233</blockquote>

<h3>Scott Adams</h3>

<blockquote>Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix. . . .p.265</blockquote>

这里与李笑来 所谓 多维竞争 是一个概念

<h3>Tracy DiNunzio</h3>

<blockquote>When you complain, nobody wants to help you.' If you spend your time focusing on the things that are wrong, and that’s what you express and project to people you know, you don’t become a source of growth for people, you become a source of destruction for people. p.305</blockquote>

<blockquote>If anybody is going to go out and pitch investors, my advice is to make your first 10 meetings with investors that you don’t really want funding from, because you’re probably going to suck in the beginning. I sucked for a really long time.” p.306</blockquote>

<h3>Daymond John</h3>

<blockquote>Five days a week, I read my goals before I go to sleep and when I wake up. There are 10 goals around health, family, business, etc., with expiration dates, and I update them every 6 months.” p. 315</blockquote>

<blockquote>My parents always taught me that my day job would never make me rich. It’d be my homework.” p. 315</blockquote>

<h3>Noah Kagan</h3>

<blockquote>For would-be entrepreneurs (he calls them “wantrapreneurs”), or entrepreneurs who’ve grown a little too comfortable, Noah has a recommendation—ask for 10% off of your next few coffees. “ p.316</blockquote>

<h3>How to Say “No” When It Matters Most</h3>

<blockquote>As legendary hedge fund manager Ray Dalio told Tony Robbins ( page 210 ): “It’s almost certain that whatever you’re going to put your money in, there will come a day when you will lose 50% to 70%.” It pays to remember that if you lose 50%, you need a subsequent 100% return to get back to where you started. That math is tough. p379</blockquote>
